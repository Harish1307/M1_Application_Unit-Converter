# Introduction 
## Unit Converter 
It makes conversion between different units of measurement for the same quantity, typically through multiplicative conversion factors.
## Conversion factor
It is used to change the units of a measured quantity without changing its value.

The process of conversion depends on the specific situation and the intended purpose. This may be governed by regulation, contract, technical specifications or other published standards. Engineering judgement may include such factors as:
- The precision and accuracy of measurement and the associated uncertainty of measurement.
- The statistical confidence interval or tolerance interval of the initial measurement.
- The number of significant figures of the measurement.
- The intended use of the measurement including the engineering tolerances.
- Historical definitions of the units and their derivatives used in old measurements; e.g., international foot vs. US survey foot.
